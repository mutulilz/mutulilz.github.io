                    <b>MY PORTFOLIO</b>
                </h2>
                <p>So far a lot has been learnt in a very short period of time. It has been a week since i started here and this is a copy of my first codings on VS code using HTML.</p>
                <p>As seen above this is just the introduction to visual studio code using HTML <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language"></abbr>.<br> I have also opened up a GitHub account where i will be posting all the projects i will be handling over the next few weeks. The link to my Git page is down below.</p>
                
                <a href="https://github.com/mutulilz"> GitHub profile.</a>
                <h2 style="text-align:center ;">WHY GEARBOX</h2>

                <p>I would want to venture into software engineering and development for a number of reasons. Our world today is growing into one that is mainly technology based. Most if not all companies and businesses run their services through technology and other data based means. <br>Being able to learn about software, coding, programming among other computer related sciences will enable me to not only fit into the ever changing world but also be able to make technology and appliances better and more resourcefull.</p>
                <p>Through Gearbox i will be able to acquire this much needed skills and background to be able to understand and therefore make changes as needed.</p>
